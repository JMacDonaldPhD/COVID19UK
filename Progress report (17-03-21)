Wrote household permutation function (NOT TESTED AT TIme of writiNG)

- Takes simulation and sample and calculates likelihood

- If zero likelihood, it is determined which households are exchangable from the initial state simulated from

- Then these household are permuted, and likelihood is calcluated once again

- Households are permuted in this way unitl a non-zero likelihood arises, or a predetermined maximum number of permutations is reached.




To work on:

# ==== Maths

Test household permutation function

# ==== Code Matainance

# Make directories in experiment files general to the user running the code

# Bake population into a simulation function, seperate from the initial state.
