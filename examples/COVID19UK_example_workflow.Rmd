Welcome to the COVID19UK package by Josh MacDonald. Despite it's name, this package does not only deal with COVID19 data. The main goal of this package is to be able to build a statistical epidemic model in a modular way, making it possible to define everything from assumptions about the underlying epidemic model to the how the epidemic is observed . This workflow workbook will focus on doing this using functions from the COVID19UK package to define an SIR epidemic model with a household population structure. A sampling process is then defined which tests individuals who enter the infectious state, with a positive test resulting in testing for the rest of the household that individual resides in. 

The block below will install the `COVID19UK` package from github, if you haven't already (or if it isn't up-to-date). R may ask you to update some packages.


```{r}

# Check COVIDUK19 Package is installed from Github (Optional Uninstall at foot of notebook)

if("COVID19UK" %in% installed.packages()){
  if(!(packageVersion("COVID19UK") == "0.1.0")){
    print("Package installed, but not up to date. Updating:")
    remotes::install_github("JMacDonaldPhD/COVID19UK")
  } else{
    print("Package installed and up to date")
  }
} else{
  print("Package not installed. Installing:")
  remotes::install_github("JMacDonaldPhD/COVID19UK")
}

# Run to uninstall package (Windows)
#remove.packages("COVID19UK", lib="~/R/win-library/3.6")



```

Create a population structure. This should be a dataframe, with each row representing an individual in the population. Each individiual has a unique ID number, a household ID, and the epidemic state they are currently in. These 3 variables are the columns of the dataframe.

```{r}

numberHouseholds <- 10
N_h <- 4 # Size of each household
N <- N_h*numberHouseholds # Size of the population
# Define initial state of individuals
indState0 <- rep(1, N)
indState0[(0:3)*4 + 1] <- 2 # Setting one person out of the first 10 households to be infected

# dataframe structure for population
pop <- data.frame(ID = 1:N,
                  householdID = as.vector(sapply(X = 1:(N/N_h), function(X) return(rep(X, N_h)))),
                  state = indState0)

# Should probably bake this into HouseholdSIR function. Why do I need to do it? Some matrix sum breaks if I don't do this.
pop$state <- factor(pop$state, levels = 1:3, labels = c("S", "I", "R"))


```


Create simulation model. The `HouseholdSIR` function takes the population structure and time frame as arguments, and returns another function which simulates a stochastic (discrete time) SIR epidemic over the given timeframe and population structure (given a set of epidemic parameters)


```{r}
# if PRINT = TRUE, a day by day breakdown of the epidemic state will be printed.
simulator <- COVID19UK::HouseholdSIR(pop, endTime = 1e2, PRINT = FALSE) # Default start time is startTime = 0

```


Now, we can define the parameters for simulation and simulate a Household SIR epidemic. There are three parameters to be defined. The first two concern the passing of infection. $beta_G$ concerns the infection rate globally, between individuals not within the same household. $beta_H$ concerns the household infection rate, i.e the rate of infectious contact between those residing in the same household. The final parameter $gamma$ concerns the movement into the removed compartment. The average number of days that in individual is infectious for is $1/gamma$.

```{r}
# Define epidemic parameters

set.seed(2)
simParam <- c(beta_G = .25, beta_H = .2, gamma = .25)

# Simulate an epidemic
#debug(simulator)
simOutput <- simulator(simParam) # This is the simulator function created above, not a function with the COVID19UK package.


```


Visualising the epidemic here.

```{r}

# visualising the epidemic here. 

# General Epidemic Curve
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
time <- 0:(nrow(simOutput$SIRsummary) - 1)
plot(time, simOutput$SIRsummary[, 1], type = 'l', col = 'blue', ylim = c(0, N))
lines(time, simOutput$SIRsummary[, 2], col = 'red')
lines(time, simOutput$SIRsummary[, 3], col = 'grey')



```


what does a typical epidemic look like for this set of parameters?

Let's plot the distribution of final sizes for a 1000 different epidemics

```{r}

set.seed(1)
simParam <- c(beta_G = .25, beta_H = 0.2, gamma = .25)
simulations <- replicate(n = 1e4, simulator(simParam), simplify = F)

finalSizes <- sapply(X = simulations, FUN = function(X) sum(X$SIRsummary[nrow(X$SIRsummary), 2:3]))
averageHouseholdFinalSizes <- sapply(X = simulations, FUN = function(X) mean(X$householdFinalSize))
propHousholdsFullyInfected <- sapply(X = simulations, FUN = function(X) sum(X$householdFinalSize == N_h)/numberHouseholds)

par(mfrow = c(1, 3))

plot(density(finalSizes, from = 0, to = N), xlab = "Size of epidemic \n (Day 10)", main = "")
plot(density(averageHouseholdFinalSizes, from = 0, to = N_h), xlab = "Average size of household epidemic \n (Day 10)", main = "")

hist.default(propHousholdsFullyInfected, breaks = (0:10)/10, main = "", xlab = "Prop. of Households Fully Infected \n (Day 10)")
#plot(density(propHousholdsFullyInfected, from = 0, to = 1), main = "Prop. of Households Fully Infected (Day 10)")


```


Simulates an epidemic which is representative of a typical epidemic given these parameters.

```{r}


`%<<%` <- function(x, y){
  return(x > y[1] & x < y[2])
}

epidemicSizeBounds <- rep(mean(finalSizes),2) + c(-5, 5)

avgHouseholdSizeBounds <- rep(mean(averageHouseholdFinalSizes), 2) + c(-.5, .5)

epidemicSize <- 0
avgHouseholdSize <- 0
while(!((epidemicSize %<<% epidemicSizeBounds) &
      (avgHouseholdSize %<<% avgHouseholdSizeBounds))){
  simulatedEpidemic <- simulator(simParam)
  epidemicSize <- sum(simulatedEpidemic$SIRsummary[endTime + 1, 2:3])
  avgHouseholdSize <- mean(simulatedEpidemic$householdFinalSize)
}



# General Epidemic Curve
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
time <- 0:(nrow(simulatedEpidemic$SIRsummary) - 1)
plot(time, simulatedEpidemic$SIRsummary[, 1], type = 'l', col = 'blue', ylim = c(0, N))
lines(time, simulatedEpidemic$SIRsummary[, 2], col = 'red')
lines(time, simulatedEpidemic$SIRsummary[, 3], col = 'grey')




```



So far, we have defined the underlying epidemic model and simulated a 'typical' realisation of such an epidemic given a set of parameters. Ultimately, we are interested in analysing epidemic data, with the goal of estimating the epidemic parameters and/or make projections, which will inform decision-making. Ideally, we would like to know the epidemic state of every individaul, on every day within a given time frame. Unfortunately, this is most likely not possible due to time/money constraints, or the inability to observe an individuals epidemic state with absolute certainty. Consequently, we must rely on a subset of the epidemic data for analysis. This brings many challanges, as well as many proposed ways to overcome these challenges.

One challenge which is applicable in a lot of situations, is there not being a closed form for the likelihood of epidemic parameters, given the sampled data (the underlying epidemic process is assumed to be unobserved). To overcome this, an unbiased estimate of the this likelihood is constructed, which can then be used as a proxy for Maximum Likelihood Estimation, or in a Bayesian setting, to calculate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) acceptance probability (which requires a closed form likelihood).

Let's first focus on obtaining a sample of epidemic data. The example below takes the epidemic simulated above (`simOutput`) and applys an observation process. The observation process is an informed testing scheme, which recruits of portion of individuals who move into the infectious state. On arrival to the infectious state, there is a non-zero probability $\alpha$ that the individual will be ascertained. On ascertainment, the household that the individual resides in is followed up for testing (the ascertained individual is not tested as it is assumed they have become infectious recently). The test is imperfect, with the uncertainty of the test depending on the true state of the individual being tested. The specitivity $\pi$ is the probability of a positive test result, given the individual is in fact infectious. The sensitivity $1 - \psi$ is the probability of a negative test result, given the individual is not infectious. $\alpha$, $\pi$ and $\psi$ are specific to the observation process and so will be referred to as the observation parameters. The `TestingNGF` function will carry out the above testing scheme, given a set of observation parameters and a realisation of a household SIR epidemic.


```{r}

# if PRINT = TRUE, a day by day breakdown of testing results will be printed
obsParam <- c(alpha = .1, pi = .9, psi = .6)
testingData <- COVID19UK::testingNGF(simulatedEpidemic, obsParam, obsWindow = c(1, 10), PRINT = FALSE) # NGF := Noise Generating Function


# Plot summary of simulated sample
# Number of recruited households on a given day
# Number of positive tests
# Number of negative tests
# Cumulative

dailyNegTests <- rowSums(testingData$ntveSecondStageTests)
dailyPosTests <- rowSums(testingData$ptveSecondStageTests)

cumNoTests <- cumsum(dailyPosTests + dailyNegTests)

plot(cumNoTests, col = 'blue', type = 'l', ylim = c(0, max(cumNoTests) + 1), ylab = "Cumulative # Tests",
     xlab = "Time (Days)")

lines(cumsum(dailyNegTests), col = 'red', lty = 2)
lines(cumsum(dailyPosTests), col = 'green', lty = 3)

legend("topleft", legend = c("Total", "Positive", "Negative"), col = c("blue", "green", "red"), lty = c(1, 3, 2))




```

Distribution of total tests, positive tests, negative tests

```{r}


set.seed(1)
samples <- replicate(n = 1e4, COVID19UK::testingNGF(simulatedEpidemic, obsParam = obsParam, obsWindow = c(1, 10), PRINT = FALSE), simplify = F)

totalTests <- sapply(X = samples, FUN = function(X) sum(X$ntveSecondStageTests + X$ptveSecondStageTests))
totalPosTests <- sapply(X = samples, FUN = function(X) sum(X$ptveSecondStageTests))
totalNegTests <- sapply(X = samples, FUN = function(X) sum(X$ntveSecondStageTests))

par(mfrow = c(1, 3))

plot(density(totalTests, from = 0, to = N), xlab = "Total Number of Tests \n (Day 10)", main = "", xlim = c(0, max(totalTests) + 5))
plot(density(totalPosTests, from = 0, to = N), xlab = "Total Number of Positive Tests \n (Day 10)", main = "", xlim = c(0, max(totalPosTests) + 5))
plot(density(totalNegTests, from = 0, to = N), xlab = "Total Number of Negative Tests \n (Day 10)", main = "", xlim = c(0, max(totalNegTests) + 5))

hist(totalTests, breaks = seq(0, max(totalTests) + 5, by = 2.5))
hist(totalPosTests, breaks = seq(0, max(totalPosTests) + 5, by = 2))
hist(totalNegTests, breaks = seq(0, max(totalNegTests)+ 5, by = 2))



```

Simulating a representative sample

```{r}

totalNegTestsBounds <- rep(mean(totalNegTests), 2) + c(-5, 5)
totalPosTestsBounds <- rep(mean(totalPosTests), 2) + c(-5, 5)

totalTestsBounds <- rep(mean(totalTests)) + c(-5, 5)

totalNegTestsSample <- 0
totalPosTestsSample <- 0
totalTestsSample <- 0
#debug(COVID19UK::testingNGF)
while(!(totalNegTestsSample %<<% totalNegTestsBounds &
      totalPosTestsSample %<<% totalPosTestsBounds &
      totalTestsSample %<<% totalTestsBounds)){

  simulatedSample <- COVID19UK::testingNGF(simulatedEpidemic, obsParam = obsParam, obsWindow = c(1, 10), PRINT = FALSE) 
  totalTestsSample <- sum(simulatedSample$ntveSecondStageTests + simulatedSample$ptveSecondStageTests)
  totalPosTestsSample <- sum(simulatedSample$ptveSecondStageTests)
  totalNegTestsSample <- sum(simulatedSample$ntveSecondStageTests)
}

dailyNegTests <- rowSums(simulatedSample$ntveSecondStageTests)
dailyPosTests <- rowSums(simulatedSample$ptveSecondStageTests)

cumNoTests <- cumsum(dailyPosTests + dailyNegTests)

plot(cumNoTests, col = 'blue', type = 'l', ylim = c(0, max(cumNoTests) + 1), ylab = "Cumulative # Tests",
     xlab = "Time (Days)")

lines(cumsum(dailyNegTests), col = 'red', lty = 2)
lines(cumsum(dailyPosTests), col = 'green', lty = 3)

legend("topleft", legend = c("Total", "Positive", "Negative"), col = c("blue", "green", "red"), lty = c(1, 3, 2))





```







It may already be clear how we cannot calculate the likelihood of this sample data being obtained, given only the epidemic parameters. The uncertainty of all test results is dependent on the actual epidemic state of the individuals being tested. Hence the uncertainty in the sample data cannot be quantified without more information about the underlying epidemic process. The `testingLlh` function will calcualte the probability of a sample being generated, given a underlying epidemic process and a set of observation parameters.


# Likelihood Maths

$(S \to I)_{i}$, the number of infections in household $i$ on a given day.

$\alpha$, Recruitment probability for new infection.

$\pi$, sensitivity of test

$\psi$, specitivity of test

$T^{(j)}_i$, the total number of $j^{th}$ stage tests done in household $i$.

$T^{(j)}_{i+}$, the number of $j^{th}$ stage tests in household $i$ which return a positive result.

$T^{(j)}_{i-}$, the number of $j^{th}$ stage tests in household $i$ which return a negative result.

Hence, $T^{(j)}_{i+} + T^{(j)}_{i-} = T^{(j)}_i$.

$(SR)_{i+}$, number of tests of non-infectious individuals, which resulted in a positive result.

$(I)_{i+}$, number of tests of non-new infectious individuals, which resulted in a positive result.

$$ \prod_{i = 1}^{H} {{(S \to I)_i}\choose{T^{(1)}_i}} \alpha^{T^{(1)}_i} (1 - \alpha)^{(S \to I)_{i} - T^{(1)}_i} \hspace{10mm} \text{(Recruitment Process)}$$

The above is interested in the probability of recruiting each individual who has become infected.

If it doesn't matter who was recruited and just whether or not the household itself is to be followed up, then the following should be calculated


Probability of recruitment of a household is $P_{ri}(\alpha, (S \to I)_i) = (1 - (1 - \alpha)^{(S \to I)_{i}})$, a function of the individual recruitment probability and the number of new infections in that household on a given day. To simplyfy, the reliance on these variables will be assumed (i.e $P_{ri}(\alpha, (S \to I)_i) \equiv P_{ri}$ )

$$ \prod_{i = 1}^{H} P_{ri}^{1\{Recruited_{i}\}}(1 - P_{ri})^{1 - 1\{Recruited_{i}\}}$$


$$ \prod_{i = 1}^{H} {{T^{(1)}_{i}}\choose{T^{(1)}_{i+}}} \pi^{T^{(1)}_{i+}} (1 - \pi)^{T^{(1)}_{i+} - T^{(1)}_{i+}} \hspace{10mm} \text{(First Stage Testing)}$$
$$
\begin{align*}
\prod_{i = 1}^{H} \sum_{(SR)_{i+}, I_{i+}} &{{S_i + R_i}\choose{(SR)_{i+}}} \psi^{(SR)_{+i}} (1 - \psi)^{S_{i} + R_{i} - (SR)_{i+}} \\ &{{I_i - T^{(1)}_{i}}\choose{I_{+i}}} \pi^{I_{+i}} (1 - \pi)^{I_{i} - T^{(1)}_{i} - I_{+i}} \\  &\cdot 1\{(SR)_{+i} + I_{+i} = T^{(2)}_{i+}\}\hspace{10mm} \text{(Second Stage Testing)}
\end{align*}
$$

## Notes

Total Likelihood = Recruitment Process * First Stage Testing * Second Stage Testing

In the second stage testing, for each household, we sum over all possible number of false positives ($(SR)_{i+}$) and true positives ($I_{i+}$) that give the required total number of second stage positive tests observed ($T^{(2)}_{i+}$).




```{r}

llhvalue <- COVID19UK::testingLlh(simulatedEpidemic, simulatedSample, obsParam, PRINT = FALSE)
llhvalue

```

Clearly, the probability of obsersving the generated sample dataset is non-zero, given that the underlying epidemic process and observation parameters provided actually generated the sample dataset itself. Changing the observation parameters will give a different result.

```{r}

# First value is log-likelihood of recruiting individuals who have become infectious
# Second Value is log-likelihood of first stage tests (i.e the results of testing those who were recruited)
# The final result is the first 2 values added plus the log-likehood of second stage testing (i.e the results of test
# from households which had a positive first stage test)
COVID19UK::testingLlh(simulatedEpidemic, simulatedSample, obsParam = rep(0.7, 3))

```

So we can calculate the likelihood of observing the testing sample, given the underlying epidemic process. What we would like to do is calculate the likelihood of the epidemic parameters given the sample data. In the absence of a closed form expression for this likelihood, we cannot calculate this exactly, only estimate/approximate it. The below result shows how we may attain a unbiased estimate of the likelihood through Monte Carlo sampling.

# Setting up epidemic model for analysis

`epiModel` returns a list of functions which can be used to carry out likelihood estimation of epidemic parameters (or a subset of epidemic parameters) and set up an MCMC sampler. `epiModel` takes the defined epidemic model (`simulator` or, in general, the output of `householdSIR`), the defined observation model (a list with named entries `NGF` and `llh`, representing the Noise generating function and likelihood calculation function respectively)
