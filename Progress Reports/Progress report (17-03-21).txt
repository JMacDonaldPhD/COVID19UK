Wrote household permutation function (NOT TESTED AT TIme of writiNG)

- Takes simulation and sample and calculates likelihood

- If zero likelihood, it is determined which households are exchangable from the initial state simulated from

- Then these household are permuted, and likelihood is calcluated once again

- Households are permuted in this way unitl a non-zero likelihood arises, or a predetermined maximum number of permutations is reached.

- Permutation function works, but can much more intensive than straight simulations. 

- When the project is loaded, a line of code is run taking the full path of the users working directory. This makes the running of experiments
  portable to other users.


To work on:

# ==== Code Matainance

# Bake population into a simulation function, seperate from the initial state.
